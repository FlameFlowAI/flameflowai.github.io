id="post-content"><p>It’s been almost two months since the last article was published, and I didn’t publish a blog post for two full months. During that time, I wanted to write a serious article, but the result was still not written! Today, after listening to a “logical thinking” on the subject of procrastination, I realized that I am already a patient with advanced procrastination. Although I also agree that procrastination is not a disease but a result of human evolution, procrastination does If it has a bad influence, I can’t do what I want, then I must treat my procrastination.</p>
<p>Baidu took a look at “Procrastination” and found the following article <a href="http://www.xinli001.com/info/1347/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 Psychological Skills for Curing Procrastination Collector’s Edition</a>, looking at the article and recalling some of my experiences , I think this article makes a lot of sense! For example, the first comparison method is often used in my work. I write all the work I have to do today in a notepad, mark the serial number, and then start from the easiest task to complete. Tick ​​a check mark next to the corresponding task in the task list to indicate completion. When more and more tasks are ticked, it will motivate you to complete those relatively difficult tasks. In fact, I think that the tenth method to decompose tasks also uses the same principle as the first method, but the objects and time are different. The first method can directly apply the comparison method for short-term small tasks. The tenth method is suitable for long-term large tasks. Tasks, large tasks must be broken down into small tasks before the comparison method can be applied.</p>
<p>Regarding the third method forbidding multi-tasking, I have had a lot of experience in doing a few things together before doing it badly. The brain is a multi-tasking operating system, but if it is not a multi-core CPU, it can essentially only perform a single task and constantly switch tasks to achieve multi-tasking. In fact, this is pseudo-multi-tasking, and switching between tasks has additional overhead. I prefer the brain to be a single-core CPU. You can try how difficult it is to draw a circle on the left and right, and you know why I said that the brain is a single-core CPU. Remember the three idiots in the movie. The teaching director “Virus” is able to write with both hands, but I think that it only reduces the overhead of task switching after long-term training. Since the brain is a single-core CPU, you must focus on improving efficiency and increase your CPU frequency through training.</p>
<p>I also have the mentality of negative perfectionism. I learned about this “negative perfectionism” on Baidu Encyclopedia. The outstanding feature of negative perfectionism is not “pursuit of perfection”, but fear of imperfection. This fear of imperfections makes me dare not do it-procrastination, gradually doubting my strength and losing confidence (the fifth method), the last thing is not achieved. In fact, perfection does not exist in reality. It is not necessary to be exact. Imperfection is true, and trueness is a kind of beauty, and beauty is fine.</p>
<p>I am also a person who is easily disturbed and distracted, so I have always been eager to do this for the second method to cut off the interference source and the ninth to set the focus time. I dream of having a study in my own room, and I will not be disturbed by anyone in the study … You see, the negative perfectionism is upset again. In fact, it is possible to eliminate as much as possible the things that may interfere with you, and then stay focused for 10 to 20 minutes, gradually training to extend the focus time.</p>
<p>In fact, at the beginning of writing this blog post, I also wanted to reprint it for myself to read later. Reprinting is very easy to complete. Then, after I have done the work required for reprinting, I might as well write my own thoughts based on my own experience. Then there is the above text. If I had thought about writing an article about my procrastination treatment at the beginning, I’m afraid that it would delay me …</p>
<p>Finally, I summarize the procrastination therapy for myself: <strong>Decompose the tasks into a table, choose the one that is easy to do first, do not seek perfection, concentrate on it</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In an ideal world, we can do things on time and according to the plan, and we can implement the plans that have been made perfectly. But in the real world, all this becomes difficult. It’s really easy to talk on paper. Anyone can make a good plan. However, we really have to do it. Various reasons arise from our minds. The surrounding temptations are also invisiblely amplified. We start to fear. I dare not do it, all kinds of excuses let us delay the task that should have been completed yesterday until today, at this moment we are still busy looking for and weaving the next excuse.</p>
<p>Is it true that procrastination cannot be overcome? Why do we lose to ourselves? The creation of procrastination is essentially that we do not like to do things that we are not interested in, so we want to delay the pain; on the other hand, what we do may take a long time to see the results, causing us to be reluctant to start. The battle against procrastination is actually a counterbalance to our lazy habits. We must form the habit of acting immediately to overcome the problem of procrastination and replace good habits with bad ones.</p>
<ol>
<li>Comparative law-let yourself accept psychologically.<br>When I thought deeply about the problem of procrastination, I realized that procrastination is actually a kind of self-deception. We are naturally lazy by nature, and I have to admit that if there is a comfortable and warm quilt, I would not be willing to get up and go to the cold outdoors. Since ancient times, we humans have evolved a self-protection function, which is to keep away from harmful and tend to be beneficial. This allows us to better survive harsh environments, an inherent mechanism of our brain. Well, the nature of procrastination is also related to this. We want to do simple and happy things rather than work that causes us pain.<br>Then, I took advantage of this feature and invented the comparison method, which is actually deceiving our brains, because our brains do not compare and are easily deceived. For example, someone might go to the B store to buy a pen that costs 30 yuan in the A store and buy the same pen that costs 20 yuan. As a result, the car cost 15 yuan.<br>This method is to pick another task B in your task list that is easier than task A you do n’t want to do at this time, and then tell yourself that A and B must complete one at this time, you can choose by yourself. Well, as a brain, I definitely think B is easier, so go for B. In fact, there may be tasks C, D, E that are easier to do than B. In this way, we successfully deceived ourselves, letting ourselves feel no longer afraid, and we can act immediately. Then, we can find a task S that is more difficult than A, so that we have a reason to do A. This is a self-deceiving method, but it works.</li>
<li>cut off the source of interference-make yourself more focused.<br>There are many sources of interference in our lives, such as mobile phones, computers, networks, etc., when we want to concentrate on one thing, especially when we want to do something that we want to delay until tomorrow, a text message from someone Maybe it will allow us to divert our attention to other things, and it will be difficult to return to the original state again. What we have to do is to simplify all the sources of interference around us, and cut off everything that we think might interrupt our focus. When I write the article myself, I will disconnect the Internet connection, mute the phone, and find a solitary environment to start writing until I finish writing. This state of focus is very important. I could finish things that took two hours to complete. I might get it done in less than an hour. So the time saved I can use to relax completely. This completes the task and gives you a good rest.</li>
<li>prohibit multi-tasking operations-simple and efficient.<br>Although our brain is a multi-tasking operating system, we can sing while bathing and listening to music while cooking. But sometimes, single-threaded work allows us to maintain a high degree of attention, allowing us to complete tasks faster, thereby reducing the number of delays, and fostering the good habit of completing immediately.</li>
<li>do not pursue perfection-give yourself a low starting point.<br>Sometimes because we are pursuing perfection, we are anxious, which causes us to be anxious about various possible problems before we start to do one thing. The end result is that we are afraid to start to do the task, making the task procrastination. In fact, we can set ourselves a very low starting point. For example, if I want to do 200 push-ups in one breath, then I can do only 10 on the first day and increase to 15 the next day. In this way, the starting point is very low, and I am more willing to believe that I can finish it without suffering, and I dare to start instead of just staying in the fantasy stage. Most of the tasks we delay are because we think of it too hard and too painful. When we lower the starting point, we will do it immediately.</li>
<li>firmly believe in their own strength-never lose confidence.<br>The thing that hates me the most is to tell others all day, “You can’t do it, you can’t do it, your ideas are stupid.” Such people don’t know how many people with dreams wipe out the colorful world of others Gets helpless. If you believe in yourself, ignore the weak. They say you can’t because they haven’t done it themselves.<br>Actually, there is such a person in each of us. When we face difficulties, there will be a voice telling us “You can’t do it, you can’t do it, it’s hard and painful.” A real person, we might tell him angrily “I can do it!” But what if we change ourselves? How much courage do we have to overcome our inner cowardice? It is these weak voices that have shaken our firm conviction that the idea of ​​how we can change the world has been delayed so far. I think there is only one solution-that is to start doing it now, once you start, there is no fear.</li>
<li>waiting for others is ridiculous-the only people who can really rely on themselves.<br>Sometimes there is only one real way to complete a task, and that is to do it yourself. We should never have the idea of ​​entrusting it to others, because it is very unreliable. Even if this person is exactly like a clock, it also has a day when the battery runs out and stops. We sometimes hope that others can do something. It is better to do it by ourselves. Although it is a bit painful, we can grasp the progress of the work instead of trying to urge others.</li>
<li>Create procrastination task list-even if we procrastinate, we have to be handsome.<br>Well, if we can’t overcome the delay, then why don’t we use this bad habit to serve us? Bohua has established a list of procrastinating tasks for himself. In this list, I have listed a lot of things that I usually don’t have time to do-such as learning gardening, reading an interesting book, and so on. The contents of these lists are all meaningful and unpleasant little things. Whenever I really don’t want to continue doing one thing, I open the procrastination list and pick one thing to do. In this way, it not only satisfies the mentality that I want to delay, but also can do things that I usually do n’t have time to do. Sometimes we can’t overcome procrastination, so why not change the angle and enjoy it?</li>
<li>Procrastination is just an idea-never start implementing it.<br>Your mind will imply that you are eating that cake, or that you are quitting smoking, that you will pick up a cigarette from someone else, or that you will delay the task that you should start until tomorrow. Alright, are you really so obedient? We must be clear that when a person has a motive for killing, it does not mean that he has killed that person. Similarly, when procrastinating thoughts start circling in our heads, all we have to do is wait and see instead of accepting instructions from our heads. The Buddhism has a viewpoint called observing. When we have evil thoughts in our hearts, we need to sit there quietly and then observe our inner world from a third person perspective. Some bad ideas, let them slowly disappear, do not judge, do not act rashly. When we want to delay, tell ourselves that this is just an idea, and I will not do it, because once the idea becomes reality, it cannot be changed.</li>
<li>set focus time-make yourself more efficient.<br>When I do n’t want to do something, I usually set a timer for myself, such as 20 minutes. I told myself that I had to focus on the task at hand within these 20 minutes, without any excuse to evade until the alarm sounded. . When 20 minutes have passed, I will rest for 5 minutes and then set the next 20 minutes. When we count down to ourselves, psychologically we will have a sense of urgency, which will prompt us to focus more on completing the task. When there is interference, I will look at the countdown and imply that I am stuck for another 3 minutes and it is over. This method is very effective. In terms of time management, the big time is divided into small pieces of time, which is easier for us to operate. It is an idea of ​​turning to zero.</li>
<li>Decompose tasks-the secret to getting started<br>Larger tasks can also be broken down into many small subtasks, and each subtask is allocated to its own available time. When all the subtasks are completed, then a seemingly impossible and difficult task is solved. The essence of decomposing a task is simplification. Decompose the task you want to delay into 10 very simple subtasks. You only need to complete 1 subtask first, and then tell yourself that this task has been completed. One part, I can take a break before I start the next subtask. In this way, we can act quickly instead of procrastinating and causing delays.</li>
